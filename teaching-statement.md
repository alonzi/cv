# Peter Alonzi Teaching Statement
My teaching philosophy is best expressed through three anecdotes that isolate my core principles. I believe in getting your hands dirty with practical work, I put others before myself, my pride comes from sucess of my students.

## Anecdote 1: Rolling dice before Ms. Morris' 2nd grade class
My second grade teacher, Ms. Morris, allowed students who arrived at school before the first bell to come in early and play quitely. She had several stations set up and I gravitated towards the math area. She had a set of polyhedral dice. I would later learn to call them by their propernames, d4, d6, d8, d10, d12, d20. I spend the entire fall rolling these dice over and over again and recording the results. I wanted to see if the dice were 'fair'. My teacher observed my play and posed a question to me, "How can you prove they are fair?". This single question opened up the world for me. I would go on to learn about histograms, statistics, and even a couple probability distributions. But the biggest lesson was that by careful observation a teacher can identify the right moment to ask the right question.
